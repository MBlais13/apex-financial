## Project Background
The problem we will be solving is one that has been around for ages. We have decided to take matters into our own hands and make a bank that is above all else, an Apex Financial decision. Our main goal is to draw in as many customers and give them a bank that is better then ever; a user friendly UX, easy decisions, and above all else an easier way to pay taxes and get your interest on time.

## Users
As the CEO of Apex we want everyone to feel welcome, every user is able to contribute on the features they like.
The stakeholders of this app is whoever would like to donate to the goal of a better banking app, The project developers for our app is [Michael Blais](https://github.com/MBlais13) for frontend development, and [Evan Brundritt](https://github.com/JustEvanB) for backend development.

## Assumptions
As a group we have decided on many assumptions. We have assumed that both backend and frontend work will take some time so we will be working on it throughout the entirety of christmas break to assure that we have perfected our platform and made every feature perfect


## Our Vision
As Apex Financial, our vision was to create a clean, simple and easy to use banking app. Unlike other banking companies with hidden fees and confusing websites we have a straight to the point banking dashboard. We take our user privacy seriously; data leaks are a thing of the past with all our data being encrypted.

## Features
* End-to-end encryption
* Industry leading two-factor authentication
* Modern user dashboard
* 1-click tax payments/interest gathering
